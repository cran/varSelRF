Dear professor Diaz-Uriarte,

I gratefully make use of varSelRF and
came across two issues for which I
would like to propose a feature request:

1) varSelRF:

  even with the verbose flag set to FALSE,
  the gc output is shown; I would prefer that
  a verbose is FALSE also hides this from the
  user; currently I need to wrap all varSelRF
  calls in a capture.output to be able to
  integrate them nicely in a Sweave document,
  for example.

2) plot.varSelRF:

  Currently, the plot method produces two plots
  at a time; for being able to integrate this in
  reports, it would again be useful to have e.g.
  a type argument to plot.varSelRF that allows
  to specify which of the two plots to display;
  if you would like to keep current behaviour and
  still allow for individual plots to be displayed,
  something along plot.lm could be done: plot four
  plots by default (which = c(1:3,5)), but allow
  for a particular plot to be chosen.

What do you think ?

Thanks again for sharing your work through this
package !

Kind regards,
